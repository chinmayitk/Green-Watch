#### "Green Watch" revolutionizes traditional farming practices by introducing a sophisticated IoT solution for smart irrigation and farm monitoring. Leveraging cutting-edge technology, this project seamlessly integrates the power of the ESP8266 microcontroller, Blynk IoT platform, and an array of sensors including fire detection and DHT sensors.

##### Key Features:

#### Remote Farm Monitoring: With the "Green Watch" mobile application, farmers can conveniently monitor their farms from anywhere. Real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and potential fire hazards are accessible at their fingertips.
#### Smart Irrigation Management: By analyzing data collected from sensors, "Green Watch" optimizes irrigation schedules based on soil moisture levels, ensuring crops receive the right amount of water at the right time. This not only conserves water but also enhances crop yield.
#### Fire Detection System: Integrated fire detection sensors provide early warnings of any potential fire outbreaks, enabling farmers to take prompt action and prevent devastating losses.
#### Weather Monitoring: The DHT sensor captures crucial weather data such as temperature and humidity, allowing farmers to make informed decisions regarding crop management and protection against adverse weather conditions.
#### ESP8266 Microcontroller: The heart of the system, the ESP8266 microcontroller, serves as the central processing unit, efficiently managing sensor data, communication with the Blynk IoT platform, and controlling irrigation systems as per the defined parameters.
#### Blynk IoT Platform Integration: Seamless integration with the Blynk IoT platform enables secure and reliable communication between the "Green Watch" system and the farmer's mobile device. Users can receive real-time notifications, control irrigation systems remotely, and analyze historical data for informed decision-making.
#### User-friendly Interface: The mobile application features an intuitive interface, allowing farmers to effortlessly navigate through different sections, view sensor data, set preferences, and customize alerts according to their specific requirements.
